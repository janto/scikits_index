You will need to have the Google App Engine installed to do anything useful.

The first time you load the package listing things might be a bit slow while package info is retrieved.
You might even experience the following errors depending on your internet speed:
    DownloadError: ApplicationError: 2 timed out
If this keeps happening, check that your is http_proxy is set.

If you find a bug, let me know and I'l fix it.
